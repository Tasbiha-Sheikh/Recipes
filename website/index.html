                        <br>
                        <br> 1 cup all-purpose flour
                        <br> 2 tablespoons sugar
                        <br>1 teaspoon baking powder

                        <br>1/4 teaspoon salt
                        <br>3/4 cup buttermilk
                        <br>1/4 cup milk
                        <br>1 large egg
                        <br>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil
                        <br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
                        <br>Butter or oil for cooking
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

                            <br>Mix Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract if using.
                            
                            <br>Combine Ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. The batter should be lumpy; do not overmix.
                            
                            <br>Preheat Pan: Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.
                            
                            <br>Cook Pancakes: Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes more.
                            
                            <br>Serve: Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings like maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or butter.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>3 eggs, beaten
                            <br>1 tsp sunflower oil
                            <br>1 tsp butter
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
                            2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.
                            3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.
                            4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds
                            5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        In a large karahi  heat the oil or ghee over medium heat.
                        
                        <br>Add Chicken:
                        Add the chicken pieces to the onions and cook until the chicken changes color and is no longer pink.
                        
                        <br>Add Ginger-Garlic Paste:

                        <br>Add Spices:
                        Add black pepper, white pepper, cumin seeds, coriander powder, and salt. Stir well to coat the chicken evenly with the spices.
                        
                       <br> Cook Yogurt:
                        Add the whisked yogurt to the chicken mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until the yogurt is well blended and the oil starts to separate from the masala.
                        
                        <br>Add Cream:
                        Lower the heat and stir in the cream. Continue to cook for a few more minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <br> <br> Prepare the chicken:
                            Chop the chicken into small 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes.
                             Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt over the chicken and mix to combine.
                             Set the chicken aside for about 10 minutes (I usually use this time to chop all the vegetables).
                            
                    
                        <br> Scramble the egg:
                            Heat a wok or large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Swirl in a tablespoon of oil and add the whisked eggs.
                             Use a spatula to quickly scramble the eggs, breaking the curds into smaller pieces as they come together.
                             Transfer the eggs to a plate.
                    
                            <br>Cook the chicken:
                                Add another tablespoon of oil in the wok or pan. 
                                Add the chicken and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                                Turn off the heat and transfer the cooked chicken to a plate.
                                Using your spatula, scrape off any chicken bits that are still stuck to the wok so they don't burn during the next step. 
                                You can also use paper towels to wipe down your wok or pan. 
                    
                                <br>Cook the vegetables:
                                    Swirl 1 tablespoon of oil into the wok over medium-high heat. 
                                    Add the diced onions and cook them for 1 minute, until they start to soften. 
                                    Mix in the minced garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
                                    Add the diced carrots and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
                                     Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the peas, and stir to incorporate.
                    
                                <br>Cook the rice:

                       <br> ½ large onion, diced, approx half cup
                       <br> 1 tsp ginger paste
                       <br> ½ tsp garlic paste
                      <br>  3 tomatoes (diced)

                     <br>   ¾-1 tsp salt

                      <br>  1 + ⅔ sliced green chilies
                      <br>  ½-3/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <br> <br> Prepare the chicken:
                        Chop the chicken into small 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes.
                         Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt over the chicken and mix to combine.
                         Set the chicken aside for about 10 minutes (I usually use this time to chop all the vegetables).
                        
                
                    <br> Scramble the egg:
                        Heat a wok or large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Swirl in a tablespoon of oil and add the whisked eggs.
                         Use a spatula to quickly scramble the eggs, breaking the curds into smaller pieces as they come together.
                         Transfer the eggs to a plate.
                
                        <br>Cook the chicken:
                            Add another tablespoon of oil in the wok or pan. 
                            Add the chicken and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                            Turn off the heat and transfer the cooked chicken to a plate.
                            Using your spatula, scrape off any chicken bits that are still stuck to the wok so they don't burn during the next step. 
                            You can also use paper towels to wipe down your wok or pan. 
                
                            <br>Cook the vegetables:
                                Swirl 1 tablespoon of oil into the wok over medium-high heat. 
                                Add the diced onions and cook them for 1 minute, until they start to soften. 
                                Mix in the minced garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
                                Add the diced carrots and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
                                 Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the peas, and stir to incorporate.
                
                            <br>Cook the rice:
                                Add the rice to the wok or pan on top of the vegetables and stir to combine. 
                                Using the back of your spatula, smash any large chunks of rice to break them apart. 
                                Add the white and green parts of the sliced scallions (save the dark green parts) and five-spice powder. Stir to incorporate. 
                                If the rice starts to stick to the pan, stir in a little more oil.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. If your chicken breasts are too big, slice them before cooking. Then, marinade the chicken breasts in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard, or all-spice powder. Leave the chicken for at least four hours or over night.
                            <br>2. An egg and two tablespoons of water should be beaten together to make the batter, which should then be set aside.
                            <br>3. Chicken breasts that have been marinated should be heavily dusted in flour. They should be well coated after being dipped in both the egg and the breadcrumbs.
                            <br>4. The coated chicken breasts should be deep-fried in heated oil over a medium-high heat until they are crisp and golden brown.
                            <br>5. The finished burger should be stacked with the lettuce on top, followed by the chicken, and then the mayonnaise or KFC zinger sauce. The buns should be cut in half and lightly toasted. If you'd like a cheesy kick, add some sliced American cheese.

Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate in an airtight container in the fridge at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.</br> 
                            <br>Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you’re using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.</br> 
                            <br> Cook Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grill grates and add the chicken. Grill the chicken about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.</br>
                           <br>Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.</br>
