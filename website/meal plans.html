                                <br>Mix Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract if using.
                                
                                <br>Combine Ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. The batter should be lumpy; do not overmix.
                                
                                <br>Preheat Pan: Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.
                                
                                <br>Cook Pancakes: Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes more.
                                
                                <br>Serve: Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings like maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or butter.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above.

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>3 eggs, beaten</br>
                            <br>1 tsp sunflower oil</br>
                            <br>1 tsp butter</br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br> Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.</br>
                        <br> Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.</br>
                        <br> Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.</br>
                        <br>Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds</br>
                        <br>Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.</br>
                        </p>

                        <p><br> STEP 1: Prep
                            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and lightly spray a baking dish with nonstick spray and set aside.</br>
                       
                           <br>STEP 2: MAKE THE CRUST
                               Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a medium bowl. Then, spread the mixture into the baking dish, pressing to form an even, smooth layer. Bake for 10 minutes, then let the crust cool completely.<br>
                            
                               <br>STEP 3: MAKE THE CHEESECAKE LAYER
                                   Beat the softened cream cheese in a medium bowl for 2 to 3 minutes until smooth and creamy. Then, add the powdered sugar and beat on low speed until combined. Finally, fold the Cool Whip into the cream cheese mixture until completely combined. Spread the cheesecake mixture evenly over the cooled graham cracker crust.</br>
                                
                                   <br>STEP 4: ADD CHERRIES AND CHILL
                                       Pour the cherry pie filling over the cheesecake layer and gently spread evenly. Place fresh cherries all over the filling if desired. Then, cover the dish with foil and chill for at least 4 hours.</br>

                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <br> <br> Prepare the chicken:
                            Chop the chicken into small 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes.
                             Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt over the chicken and mix to combine.
                             Set the chicken aside for about 10 minutes (I usually use this time to chop all the vegetables).
                            </br>
                    
                        <br> Scramble the egg:
                            Heat a wok or large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Swirl in a tablespoon of oil and add the whisked eggs.
                             Use a spatula to quickly scramble the eggs, breaking the curds into smaller pieces as they come together.
                             Transfer the eggs to a plate.</br>
                    
                            <br>Cook the chicken:
                                Add another tablespoon of oil in the wok or pan. 
                                Add the chicken and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                                Turn off the heat and transfer the cooked chicken to a plate.
                                Using your spatula, scrape off any chicken bits that are still stuck to the wok so they don't burn during the next step. 
                                You can also use paper towels to wipe down your wok or pan. </br>
                    
                                <br>Cook the vegetables:
                                    Swirl 1 tablespoon of oil into the wok over medium-high heat. 
                                    Add the diced onions and cook them for 1 minute, until they start to soften. 
                                    Mix in the minced garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
                                    Add the diced carrots and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
                                     Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the peas, and stir to incorporate.</br>
                    
                                <br>Cook the rice:
                                    Add the rice to the wok or pan on top of the vegetables and stir to combine. 
                                    Using the back of your spatula, smash any large chunks of rice to break them apart. 
                                    Add the white and green parts of the sliced scallions (save the dark green parts) and five-spice powder. Stir to incorporate. 
                                    If the rice starts to stick to the pan, stir in a little more oil.
                                    Drizzle the soy sauce and sesame oil over the rice and stir to incorporate. Stir in the cooked chicken, scrambled eggs, and the dark parts of the scallions. 
                                    Stir briefly to bring it together, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</br>
                                <br> Serve:
                                       Taste, and add more soy sauce if necessary. Serve immediately</br>

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br> Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven’t already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.</br>
                            <br>Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season the chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add them to the marinade. Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate in an airtight container in the fridge at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.</br> 
                            <br>Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you’re using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.</br> 
                            <br> Cook Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grill grates and add the chicken. Grill the chicken about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.</br>
                           <br>Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.</br>
